### Installation steps for Terraform Cloud
1. Download the latest `linux_amd64` release from https://github.com/n3integration/terraform-provider-godaddy/releases
2. Unpack to `<project folder>/terraform.d/plugins/linux_amd64`.
3. Rename to match naming scheme: `terraform-provider-<NAME>_vX.Y.Z` https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html#third-party-plugins
4. Run `terraform init` to make sure the provider is initialized properly.

## API Key
In order to leverage the GoDaddy APIs, an [API key](https://developer.godaddy.com/keys/) is required. The key pair can be optionally stored in environment variables.

```bash
export GODADDY_API_KEY=abc
export GODADDY_API_SECRET=123
```

## Provider

If `key` and `secret` aren't provided under the `godaddy` `provider`, they are expected to be exposed as environment variables: `GODADDY_API_KEY` and `GODADDY_API_SECRET`.

```terraform
provider "godaddy" {
  key = "abc"
  secret = "123"
}
```

## Domain Record Resource
A `godaddy_domain_record` resource requires a `domain`. If the domain is not registered under the account that owns the key, an optional `customer` number can be specified.
Additionally, one or more `record` instances are required. For each `record`, the `name`, `type`, and `data` attributes are required. `MX` records can optionally specify `priority` or will default to `0`. Address and NameServer records can be
defined using shorthand-notation as `addresses = [""]` or `nameservers = [""]`, respectively unless you need to override the default time-to-live (3600). The available record
types include:

* A
* AAAA
* CAA
* CNAME
* MX
* NS
* SOA
* SRV
* TXT

```terraform
resource "godaddy_domain_record" "gd-fancy-domain" {
  domain   = "fancy-domain.com"

  // required if provider key does not belong to customer
  customer = "1234"

  // specify zero or more record blocks
  // a record block allows you to configure A, or NS records with a custom time-to-live value
  // a record block also allow you to configure AAAA, CNAME, TXT, or MX records
  record {
    name = "www"
    type = "CNAME"
    data = "fancy.github.io"
    ttl = 3600
  }

  record {
    name = "@"
    type = "MX"
    data = "aspmx.l.google.com."
    ttl = 600
    priority = 1
  }

  record {
    name      = "@"
    type      = "SRV"
    data      = "host.example.com"
    ttl       = 3600
    service   = "_ldap"
    protocol  = "_tcp"
    port      = 389
  }

  // specify any A records associated with the domain
  addresses   = ["192.168.1.2", "192.168.1.3"]

  // specify any custom nameservers for your domain
  // note: godaddy now requires that the 'custom' nameservers are first supplied through the ui
  nameservers = ["ns7.domains.com", "ns6.domains.com"]
}
```

## Building for Linux

```bash
make linux
```

### Additional Information
If your zone contains existing data, please ensure that your Terraform resource configuration includes all existing records, otherwise they will be removed.

This plugin also supports Terraform's [import](https://www.terraform.io/docs/import/usage.html) feature. This will at least allow you to determine the changes introduced
through `terraform plan` and update the resource configuration accordingly to preserve existing data. The supplied resource `id` to the `terraform import` command should
be the name of the domain that you would like to import. Although this is currently a manual workaround, this plugin will be updated when Terraform includes support for
fully automated imports.

#### Import Example
```bash
terraform import godaddy_domain_record.gd-fancy-domain fancy-domain.com
```
