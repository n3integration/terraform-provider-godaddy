# GoDaddy Provider

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
=======
The GoDaddy Provider supports Terraform's `import` feature to make it easier to deal with existing records that are supplied by GoDaddy by default.

#### Import Example

To import any pre-existing GoDaddy resource data into your local Terraform state file, Terraform should be invoked using the `import` command with the fully-qualified resource name and domain name as command arguments. For example:

```bash
terraform import godaddy_domain_record.mydomain mydomain.com
```
